## Starting the server
The server uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and is started using:
```
node channel_server.js
```
The default port is 8080. If you want to change that you will have to modify `channel_server.js`.

## Local testing
The simple WebRTC app is now running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
